<p>Here are descriptions of the activities of the club:</p>
<h3>Walks</h3>
<p>There are weekly field trips, usually on Sundays, from early July through late October. (Sometimes from late June through early November.) These are usually within driving distance of Boston, but range across southeast New England, from Gloucester to Cape Cod to southern New Hampshire to Concord and farther west. Occasionally, some are farther afield. The usual practice of the BMC is to create a schedule of walks for the entire season and mail it to members of the BMC in late June. This schedule is not posted on the BMC website. But guests are generally welcome - please contact the club if you'd like to attend a walk or two and see what it's about.</p>
<p>At a walk, members and guests arrive at the time and place given in the walk schedule. People get out their collecting gear, put on their bug repellent, talk about what they've seen during the week - friendly mycological chit-chat. Someone from the ID committee will give preliminary advice about mushroom collecting and answer a few questions. The host gives information about the area in which people will be walking - interesting features or history can be pointed out. Sometimes a map of the area is handed out to show trails, ponds, sights, etc. The group agrees on a time to return to the meeting place. Then all set out. Generally, we do not walk as one group through the area. Instead, people break up into individuals on their own, or small groups of two or three who walk together. Each person carries a collecting basket and collects whatever fungi they come across. Some people stay to the trails and collect what is seen trail-side. Others go "cross-country" or "bushwhacking" through the woods. Some go straight to the spots they think most fruitful, others prefer to explore more serendipitously.</p>
<p>At the agreed upon time, usually an hour or two later, all meet back at the starting place with their basket of collections. There are usually tables set up so that all mushrooms can be taken out of the baskets and organized into groups of similar species. This allows everyone to see what the entire group has been able to collect. Because the group dispersed and covered different areas, there are often fungi found by some that others did not come across. Someone from the ID Committee of the club will talk about the mushrooms collected and answer questions from the group. This is an excellent time for discussion and comparison of mushrooms. The mushrooms are then put into ice chests so that they can be taken to the Monday night meeting the next evening. A list of the mushrooms identified is written up and recorded.</p>
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>Each Monday evening following a walk an identification meeting is held in the Club room, at which time specimens collected are further examined, and doubtful ones identified with the help of the Club library. In addition, on the first Monday of every month during the off season a meeting is devoted to talks and exhibits. The subjects cover various aspects of mycology, mushroom cookery, mushrooms in art and history, photography, et cetera.</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>The excellent working and reference library is available to members for use in the Club room.</p>
<h3>Publications</h3>
<p>Four bulletins are issued each year, with supplements as material is available. Also important is the checklist of species reported since the founding of the Club, which is revised from time to time, and re-issued.</p>
<h3>Social Activities</h3>
<p>A Banquet in late Fall and a Culinary Feast in Spring serve tradition and innovation in a marinade of education and camaraderie</p>
